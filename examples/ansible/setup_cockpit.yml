# Ansible Playbook: Setup Cockpit Web server on ALP Dolomite
# Description: This Ansible playbook automates the deployment of the Cockpit Web server on an ALP Dolomite host.
# If 'extend_functionality' is set to 'true', it also installs 'cockpit-tukit' to enhance Cockpit's capabilities, with a system reboot recommended afterward.
# The steps are based on: [https://documentation.suse.com/alp/dolomite/html/alp-dolomite/available-alp-workloads.html#task-run-cockpit-with-podman]
# Administering SUSE ALP Dolomite using Cockpit Documentation: [https://documentation.suse.com/alp/dolomite/single-html/cockpit-alp-dolomite/]
